- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest for veteran performance prediction, Gradient Boosting for injury risk assessment
- **AI Confidence Scoring**: Dynamic confidence calculation based on data quality and model certainty
- **Predictive Analytics**: Trend detection, breakout candidate identification, and regression prediction

### Comprehensive Data Processing
- **All 8 CSV Files**: Processes weekly/yearly player/team offense/defense statistics
- **AI Preprocessing**: Outlier detection, missing value imputation, data normalization, feature engineering
- **2025 Rookie Integration**: Combines combine metrics, draft position, and athletic scores
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic scoring based on draft position and available players

### Intelligent Player Classification
- **2024 NFL Veterans**: Currently active players with proven production (+50 bonus)
- **2023 NFL Veterans**: Recently active players with established track record (+25 bonus)
- **2025 Rookies**: High-upside prospects with athletic profiles (+30 bonus)
- **Inactive Players**: Automatically excluded from recommendations

### Neural Network-Inspired Scoring System

#### Layer 1 - Base Performance
- **NFL Veterans**: Historical stats → Trend analysis → Future projection
- **2025 Rookies**: Combine metrics → College production → Situation analysis

#### Layer 2 - Context Factors
- Team efficiency × Position scarcity × Age curve × Usage patterns

#### Layer 3 - AI Enhancements
- Breakout probability × Injury risk × Consistency prediction × Ceiling estimation

#### Layer 4 - Meta Factors
- News sentiment analysis × Market inefficiencies × Opponent strength
